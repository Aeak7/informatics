# Data Mining 
## Spatial Data
 - Geographical data

## Five V's of Data
 - Volume: large amounts
 - Variety: different kinds of data
 - Value: useful data
 - Velocity: high speed of collection
 - Veracity: inconsistencies and uncertainty in data

## Why not Traditional Data?
 - Tremendous amounts of fdata
 - High dimensionality
 - High complexity of data

## What is Data Mining?
 - non-trivial extraction of previously unknown/useful/not obvious data
 - exploration/analysis of large quanities of data to find meaning
 - pre-process, data mine, post-process
 - novel: not obivous, valid: broadly applicable, meaningful: humans can understand, useful

## Tasks
 - Clustering
 - Association
 - Anomaly Detection
 - Predictive Modeling

## Types of other Tasks
- Classification
- Spatial Prefictive Models
- Text Mining: Summarize, Sentiment Analysis

## General Notes
 - Everyday we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data, 90% created in last 2 years alone 
 - Kilobyte 10^3^, Megabyte 10^6^, Gigabyte 10^9^, Terabyte 10^12^
 - Bonferroni's Principle: bound to find meaningless patterns
