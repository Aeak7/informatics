Bohemian Rhapsody
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
No, we will not let you go (let him go)
We will not let you go (let him go)
We will not let you go (let me go)
Will not let you go (let me go)
Never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Wonderwall
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
And by now, you should've somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
And by now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)

Party In The USA
I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame, excess, whoa am I gotta fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah!"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah!"
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks
She's gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And the Britney song was on
And the Britney song was on
And the Britney song was on
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah!"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah!"
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Feel like hoppin' on a flight, on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight, town tonight
Something stops me every time, every time
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah!"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah!"
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah!"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah!"
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!

Island In The Sun
Hip-hip
Hip-hip
Hip-hip
Hip-hip
When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
Hip-hip
Hip-hip
When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore
Hip-hip
Hip-hip
Hip-hip
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore
Hip-hip
(Hip-hip) we'll never feel bad anymore
Hip-hip
No, no (hip-hip)
(Hip-hip) we'll never feel bad anymore

Out Of Time
Yeah, yeah
The last few months, I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him, you made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said, I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (ah)
If he mess up just a little, baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little, then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little, baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I should've loved you all the time
And I remember when I held you (held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him, you made up your mind (uh)
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (no)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (hey)
Said, I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, singing (out of time)
Said, I had you to myself, but I'm (out of time)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (uh)
Out of time, out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come before you're completely engulfed
In the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed, free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name, but before you dwell in that house forever
Here's 30 minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks, on 103.5 Dawn FM

As It Was
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's comin' to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

The Less I Know The Better
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I hope they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
She said, "It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"

Ain't It Fun
I don't mind
Letting you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain't it good?
Being all alone
Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Where you can ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you?
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain't it good?
Being all alone?
Ain't it good to be on your own?
Ain't it fun? You can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own?
Ain't it fun? You can't count on no one
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun?
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun?
Ain't it fun?
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain't it good? (Ain't it good?)
Being all alone
Ain't it fun living in the real world?
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good? (Ain't it good?)
Being all alone
Don't go crying to your mama (Run to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Don't go crying)
Don't go crying to your mama (To your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Somebody That I Used To Know
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (aah-ooh)
And I don't even need your love (ooh)
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (aah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (ooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (aah)
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)
I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
Somebody

So tight, so fly
You got me lifted, you got me lifted
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
You know it's leather when we ride
Woodgrain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens, gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Off top, I can't lie, I love to get blowed
You're my lil' sugar, I'm your little chulo
And every time we kick it, it's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky icky or my sweet ooh-wee, gooey (for real though)
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Now I ain't worried about a thang 'cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a super fly chick
And uh-uh, there ain't nothin' you can say to a player
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce and Gabbana, hydro in a Cubana
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Savin' Me
Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you, well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you, come please, I'm callin'
And, oh, I scream for you
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing

And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin' and all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And, oh, I scream for you come please
I'm callin' and all I need from you, hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
